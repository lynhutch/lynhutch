# Hello, I'm Jocelyn Hutcherson!

I'm a Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University with a passion for web and graphic design. I also have an interest in game design that stems from my love of video games. When I'm not working on a design project, I love to read, crochet, and learn new things about the world around me.


## :computer: Web Design

- I first learned the basics of HTML in middle school during an IT class. I rediscovered my interest in coding when I started college.
- Currently, I'm more proficient with front-end design, focusing on work with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.


## :art: Graphic Design

- My interest in graphic design stems from my love of books. Covers are the impression of a story and they inspired me to create designs that intrigue people.
- I work more with Photoshop and Illustrator, but I'm currently learning InDesign and After Effects.
